    answer:
      "Typical IT support covers infrastructure monitoring, system maintenance, cybersecurity checks, cloud management, troubleshooting, and technical guidance.

    category: "General",
    question: "How do I choose the right IT service provider?",
    answer:
      "Look for a provider that understands both technology and business outcomes. The right partner should be able to explain what they build, show relevant case studies, support the full product lifecycle, and work with your team in a clear, collaborative way. A strong provider will focus on risk reduction, measurable results, and growth—not just task completion.",

    question: "What are the benefits of managed IT services?",
    answer:
      "Managed IT services reduce downtime, improve response times, and give you a predictable support model. They also help you stay secure, keep systems updated, and free up internal teams to focus on strategy rather than daily tech issues. For startups and scaling businesses, that means more consistency and less operational friction.",
  },
  {
    category: "Company",
    question: "Do you provide IT services in the USA and UAE?",

  },
  {
    category: "Services",
    question: "What is digital marketing and why does it matter?",
    answer:
      "Digital marketing is the use of online channels to attract, engage, and convert customers.

It matters because most buyers discover and evaluate businesses online before they ever speak to a sales team.",
  },
  {
    category: "Services",
    question: "What is an SEO audit and why is it important?",
    answer:
      "An SEO audit reviews the technical, content, and authority factors affecting your website’s rankings and visibility.

  },
  {
    category: "Services",

  },
  {
    category: "Services",
    question: "What are cloud IT services?",
    answer:
      "Cloud IT services are tools and infrastructure delivered over the internet instead of a local server setup.

The benefit is flexibility, cost efficiency, and easier access across distributed teams.",
  },
  {
    category: "Startups",
    question: "How can startups benefit from IT services?",
    answer:
      "Startups often need to move fast without wasting budget. The right IT partner can help them build quickly, improve usability, reduce technical debt, and stay focused on product-market fit. That means better execution, stronger trust with users, and a more scalable foundation as the business grows.",
